      The more you write code, the more you understand there are problems you
      have never faced, the more you realize you don’t know. Thus it motivates
      you to keep coding even more.I like the idea that I can create something
      that other people use, and enjoy.I also love that I can create things from
      my imagination and see them come to life for others as well as for me.and
      community I don’t know any other profession with a community so big and
      active and willing to help.The feeling you get from creating something
      from nothing.
