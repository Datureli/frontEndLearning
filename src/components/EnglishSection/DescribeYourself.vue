      my name is Paweł and I've been learning front end for almost two years.
      the technology I focus on most is vue js. what do you like the most about
      vue js? I like its architecture, the way of writing code based on single
      file component, vue has extensive documentation and a large community
      focused around her I like the fact that it’s constantly challenging my
      brain.The more you write code, the more you understand there are problems
      you have never faced, the more you realize you don’t know. Thus it
      motivates you to keep coding even more.I like the idea that I can create
      something that other people use, and enjoy.I also love that I can create
      things from my imagination and see them come to life for others as well as
      for me.and community I don’t know any other profession with a community so big and active and willing to help.The feeling you get from creating something from nothing.
